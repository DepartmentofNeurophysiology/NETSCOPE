## Introduction
Genehub (working title) is a MATLAB toolbox for construction and analysis of gene co-expression networks based on gene expression (GE) data. The toolbox includes a data processing pipeline (DPP) that takes in data generated by e.g. RNA-seq and constructs a network based on correlation between transcripts. The network edges are quantified by mutual information (MI) and shuffle-corrected to filter out correlations produced by chance. The network is sparsified by removing indirect correlations using the principle of data processing inequality (DPI).

## State
This toolbox is still a work in progress. Once ready it will be published along with documentation for anyone to use.
